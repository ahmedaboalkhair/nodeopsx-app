# nodeopsx-app
NodeOpsX is a full DevOps pipeline project that demonstrates CI/CD for a Node.js app using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), GitHub, ArgoCD (GitOps), Prometheus, and Grafana — all running locally. The pipeline automates testing, container builds, deployments, and monitoring from code to production.
